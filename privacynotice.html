    </header>

    <p>
        The company, located at Timpaan 1-B 1628 MT Hoorn, is responsible for the processing of personal data as shown in this privacy statement.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Details</h2>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:info@raimonvibe.com">info@raimonvibe.com</a></p>

    <h2>Personal Data That We Process</h2>
    <p>
        Raimonvibe takes your privacy seriously and is transparent about the personal data we process. When you visit our website or use our services, we may process the following personal data about you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contact information such as your email address, if you voluntarily provide it to us when filling out a contact form or signing up for our newsletter.</li>
        <li>Information about your browsing behavior on our website to improve our services and your user experience. This includes data collected through cookies, such as pages visited, click behavior, and the duration of your visit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose of and Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
        We process your personal data for specific purposes and on valid legal grounds, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To contact you and respond to your requests or questions, if you have given us permission to do so.</li>
        <li>For analyzing your use of our website with the aim to improve our website and services. We do this on the basis of our legitimate interest to continuously optimize our service delivery.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations, such as maintaining records for tax purposes or responding to requests from competent authorities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        Raimonvibe will not sell, share, or disclose your personal data to third parties without your permission, unless necessary for the performance of our agreement with you or to comply with a legal obligation. In cases where we cooperate with external service providers or partners, we ensure that appropriate agreements are in place to protect your privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Security and Retention of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
        We take the protection of your personal data seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unlawful processing, loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Your personal data will not be retained for longer than is strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which your data is collected.
    </p>

    <h2>Special and/or Sensitive Personal Data That We Process</h2>
    <p>
        Our website and/or service does not intend to collect data about website visitors who are younger than 16 years of age unless they have permission from their parents or guardian. However, we cannot check whether a visitor is older than 16. We therefore advise parents to be involved in their children's online activities in order to prevent data about children from being collected without parental consent. If you are convinced that we have collected personal information about a minor without this consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@raimonvibe.com">info@raimonvibe.com</a>, and we will delete this information.
    </p>

        <li>The company tracks your surfing behavior on various websites which we adapt our products and services to your needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Automated Decision-Making</h2>
    <p>
        The company makes business decisions based on automated processing on matters that can have (significant) consequences for people. These are decisions made by computer programs or systems, without the involvement of a person (for example, an employee of the company). The company uses the following computer programs or systems:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://heapanalytics.com/">Heap Analytics</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://cookie-script.com/">CookieScript</a></li>
    </ul>

        <p>
            Collecting feedback from clients is a way to show that I value
            their opinions. By asking my clients for feedback, I communicate
            that their opinions are important to me. I involve them in
            shaping my business, so they feel more connected to my company.
            By listening to their voices, I can build a sustainable
            connection with them.
